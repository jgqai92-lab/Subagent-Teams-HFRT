## Core Principle

**A moat is not a brand name or a market share number -- it is a structural advantage that allows a company to earn returns above the cost of capital for a measurable duration.**

Moat assessment is the bridge between business analysis and valuation. Without a durable moat, current margins are transitory and high multiples are unjustified. A company trading at 25x earnings with no moat is not a growth stock -- it is a mean-reversion trade waiting to happen. The framework demands evidence for each moat type, a durability test, and a trend assessment because the question is not just "does a moat exist today" but "will it exist in 10 years."

The uncomfortable truth: most companies that analysts describe as "having a moat" actually don't -- they have temporary advantages that erode under competition. Brand awareness is not a moat unless it commands a measurable price premium. Market share is not a moat unless it's defended by structural barriers. This framework forces the analyst to name the moat type, present the evidence, test the durability, and assess the trend. Vague claims of competitive advantage do not survive this process.

## Moat Definition

A **moat** is a structural competitive advantage that allows a company to:
1. Earn returns above the cost of capital
2. Defend against competitive attacks
3. Sustain superior economics over time

## Moat Types and Evidence

### 1. Cost Advantage

**Definition:** Ability to produce at lower cost than competitors.

**Sources:**
- Scale economies
- Process innovations
- Preferential access to inputs
- Geographic advantages
- Lower labor costs

**Evidence Required:**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Higher gross margins vs. peers | Financial comparison |
| Ability to compete on price profitably | Margin analysis at different price points |
| Declining unit costs over time | Historical cost analysis |
| Competitors unable to match costs | Peer cost structure analysis |

**Durability Test:**
- Can competitors achieve similar scale?
- Is cost advantage structural or temporary?
- Are input cost advantages sustainable?

### 2. Switching Costs

**Definition:** Costs (financial, time, psychological) that customers face when changing suppliers.

**Sources:**
- Integration with customer operations
- Data lock-in
- Contractual obligations
- Retraining requirements
- Relationship dependencies

**Evidence Required:**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| High customer retention rates | Cohort analysis, retention metrics |
| Low churn despite competitive offers | Churn data, win-back rates |
| Customers accept price increases | Pricing power history |
| Long customer tenure | Customer lifetime data |

**Durability Test:**
- Are switching costs increasing or decreasing?
- Do new technologies reduce switching costs?
- How sticky is the data/integration?

### 3. Network Effects

**Definition:** Value of product increases as more people use it.

**Sources:**
- Direct network effects (user-to-user value)
- Indirect network effects (platform ecosystems)
- Two-sided markets
- Data network effects

**Evidence Required:**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Engagement increases with user growth | Usage metrics vs. user count |
| Winner-take-most market structure | Market share concentration |
| High barriers to multi-homing | User behavior data |
| Self-reinforcing growth | Viral coefficients, organic growth |

**Durability Test:**
- Is there meaningful multi-homing?
- Can the network be fragmented?
- How defensible is the network vs. well-funded competitor?

### 4. Intangible Assets

**Subtype A: Brand**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Price premium vs. generic/private label | Price comparison studies |
| Consumer preference in blind tests | Survey data, market research |
| High brand awareness | Brand tracking studies |
| Consistent brand over time | Historical brand positioning |

**Subtype B: Patents/IP**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Patent portfolio breadth | Patent database analysis |
| Litigation success | Court records |
| Time until expiration | Patent filing dates |
| Barriers to design around | Technical assessment |

**Subtype C: Regulatory/Licenses**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Exclusive licenses | Regulatory filings |
| High barriers to new licenses | Regulatory framework |
| Long duration | License terms |
| Political sustainability | Policy analysis |

**Durability Test:**
- Is brand equity growing or eroding?
- How long until patents expire?
- Is regulatory environment stable?

### 5. Efficient Scale

**Definition:** Market is only large enough to support a limited number of profitable competitors.

**Sources:**
- Natural monopolies
- High fixed costs relative to market size
- Geographic constraints

**Evidence Required:**
| Evidence | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Limited number of competitors | Market structure analysis |
| Rational competitive behavior | Pricing/capacity discipline |
| Returns above cost of capital | Financial returns |
| Entry attempts fail | Industry history |

**Durability Test:**
- Could market grow to support more competitors?
- Are there technological disruption risks?
- Is the efficient scale advantage regulatory or structural?

## Moat Width Assessment

### Width Categories

| Width | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **None** | No sustainable competitive advantage | Commodity producer |
| **Narrow** | Advantage exists but limited duration (<10 years) | Regional brand |
| **Wide** | Durable advantage (10-20+ years) | Global platform |

### Width Scoring

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Advantage strength | 30% | | |
| Duration expectation | 30% | | |
| Competitive threats | 20% | | |
| Historical track record | 20% | | |
| **Total** | 100% | | |

| Score Range | Moat Width |
|-------------|------------|
| 1.0-2.0 | None |
| 2.1-3.5 | Narrow |
| 3.6-5.0 | Wide |

## Moat Trend Assessment

### Trend Categories

| Trend | Definition | Indicators |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Strengthening** | Moat is getting wider | Market share gains, margin expansion, increasing returns |
| **Stable** | Moat is holding | Consistent share, margins, returns |
| **Weakening** | Moat is eroding | Share losses, margin compression, declining returns |

### Trend Indicators

| Indicator | Strengthening | Stable | Weakening |
|-----------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Market share | Growing | Flat | Declining |
| Pricing power | Increasing | Maintained | Decreasing |
| ROIC trend | Improving | Consistent | Declining |
| Competitor success | Low | Moderate | High |
| Customer retention | Improving | Stable | Declining |

### Summary Assessment

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Primary Moat Source** | [Main source] |
| **Secondary Moat Sources** | [Other sources] |
| **Moat Width** | None / Narrow / Wide |
| **Moat Trend** | Strengthening / Stable / Weakening |

*If the advantage wouldn't survive a well-funded competitor with 5 years and $1B, it's not a moat.*
