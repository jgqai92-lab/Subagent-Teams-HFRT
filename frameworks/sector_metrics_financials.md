# Financials Sector Metrics Framework

## Purpose
Define key performance indicators and benchmarks for financial companies across sub-sectors.

## Banks (Commercial, Regional, Investment)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **NIM** | Net Interest Margin | >3.5% | 2.5-3.5% | <2.5% |
| **NII Growth** | Net Interest Income growth | >10% | 5-10% | <5% or negative |
| **Fee Income %** | Non-interest income / Revenue | >40% | 25-40% | <25% |
| **Efficiency Ratio** | Non-interest expense / Revenue | <55% | 55-65% | >65% |
| **ROTCE** | Return on Tangible Common Equity | >15% | 10-15% | <10% |
| **ROA** | Return on Assets | >1.2% | 0.8-1.2% | <0.8% |
| **CET1 Ratio** | Common Equity Tier 1 / RWA | >12% | 10-12% | <10% |
| **NPL Ratio** | Non-Performing Loans / Total Loans | <1% | 1-2% | >2% |
| **NCO Ratio** | Net Charge-Offs / Avg Loans | <0.5% | 0.5-1% | >1% |
| **Reserve Coverage** | Allowance / NPLs | >150% | 100-150% | <100% |
| **LDR** | Loan-to-Deposit Ratio | 80-90% | 70-100% | <70% or >100% |

### NIM Decomposition
```
NIM = (Interest Income - Interest Expense) / Average Earning Assets

Drivers:
- Asset yields (loan pricing, securities mix)
- Funding costs (deposit beta, wholesale funding)
- Asset mix (loans vs. securities)
- Rate environment sensitivity
```

### Credit Quality Waterfall
```
Criticized Assets → NPLs → NCOs
      ↓               ↓        ↓
   Watch List    Workout    Loss

Reserve Build = Provision - NCOs
```

### Red Flags
- Rising criticized/classified loans
- NIM compression without volume offset
- Deposit outflows requiring wholesale funding
- CRE concentration (>300% of capital)
- Insider loan issues
- BSA/AML compliance problems
- Rapid loan growth (>15% without explanation)

## Insurance (P&C, Life, Specialty)

### P&C Insurance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **Combined Ratio** | (Loss + Expense) / Earned Premium | <95% | 95-100% | >100% |
| **Loss Ratio** | Incurred Losses / Earned Premium | <60% | 60-70% | >70% |
| **Expense Ratio** | Underwriting Expense / Written Premium | <30% | 30-35% | >35% |
| **Accident Year Loss Ratio** | Current year losses only | Track trend | | Deteriorating |
| **Prior Year Development** | Reserve releases/strengthening | Favorable | Neutral | Adverse |
| **Retention Rate** | Renewed premium / Expiring premium | >85% | 75-85% | <75% |
| **Investment Yield** | Investment income / Avg invested assets | >3% | 2-3% | <2% |
| **ROE** | Net Income / Avg Equity | >12% | 8-12% | <8% |

### Combined Ratio Decomposition
```
Combined Ratio = Loss Ratio + Expense Ratio
              = (Current AY Loss Ratio + Prior Year Development) + Expense Ratio

Underwriting Profit = Premium - (Losses + Expenses)
If CR < 100%: Underwriting profit
If CR > 100%: Underwriting loss (must be offset by investment income)
```

### Life Insurance Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Statutory Capital** | Risk-based capital ratio | >350% |
| **Spread Income** | Investment yield - Credited rate | Positive, stable |
| **Persistency** | Policies in force retention | >90% |
| **Mortality/Morbidity** | Actual vs. expected claims | At or below expected |

| **AUM Growth** | Assets Under Management change | >10% | 0-10% | Negative |
| **Organic Growth** | Net flows / Beginning AUM | >5% | 0-5% | Negative |
| **Net Flows** | Inflows - Outflows | Positive | Neutral | Negative |
| **Revenue Yield** | Revenue / Avg AUM (bps) | Stable/Up | Slight decline | Sharp decline |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Income / Revenue | >35% | 25-35% | <25% |

| **Investment Performance** | % AUM beating benchmark | >60% | 50-60% | <50% |

### AUM Bridge
```
Ending AUM = Beginning AUM + Net Flows + Market Appreciation + FX Impact

Net Flows = Gross Sales - Redemptions

Organic Growth Rate = Net Flows / Beginning AUM
```

|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Active Equity | 50-100 | Declining |
| Active Fixed Income | 25-50 | Declining |

### Red Flags
- Persistent negative flows
- Fee compression without cost offset
- Investment underperformance (>3 years)
- Key personnel departures

= FFO

FFO
- Recurring capex (maintenance)
- Straight-line rent adjustment
- Stock compensation
= AFFO
```

| Multifamily | 4-6% | Demographics, supply |
| Office | 6-8% | WFH trends, employment |
| Retail | 6-9% | E-commerce impact, traffic |
| Healthcare | 5-7% | Demographics, reimbursement |

### Vintage Analysis Framework
```
Vintage = Loans originated in a given period

Track each vintage's:
- Loss curve (cumulative losses over time)
- Delinquency progression
- Recovery rates

Compare vintages to assess:
- Underwriting changes
- Economic cycle impact
- Model accuracy
```

### Red Flags
- Delinquency uptick (leading indicator)
- Vintage deterioration
- Loosening underwriting standards
- Funding cost pressure
- Regulatory scrutiny (rates, practices)
- Concentration in stressed demographics

## Financials Valuation Context

### Typical Multiples

| Sub-Sector | P/E | P/TBV | P/B | Key Driver |
|------------|-----|-------|-----|------------|
| Large Banks | 10-14x | 1.5-2.5x | 1.0-1.5x | ROTCE, credit |
| Regional Banks | 10-14x | 1.2-2.0x | 1.0-1.5x | NIM, credit |
| P&C Insurance | 10-14x | 1.5-2.5x | 1.2-1.8x | Combined ratio |
| Life Insurance | 8-12x | 0.8-1.5x | 0.8-1.2x | Spread, capital |
| Asset Management | 12-18x | N/A | 2-5x | Flows, AUM |

| Specialty Finance | 8-12x | 1.0-2.0x | 0.8-1.5x | Credit, ROA |

### Bank Valuation Framework
```
P/TBV = (ROE - g) / (COE - g)

Where:
- ROE = Sustainable return on equity
- g = Growth rate
- COE = Cost of equity

Higher ROE → Higher P/TBV multiple deserved
```

### Premium Factors
- Consistent credit outperformance
- Sustainable ROE above cost of equity
- Fee income diversification
- Strong deposit franchise
- Clean regulatory record
