## Core Principle

**Management quality is the single most underweighted factor in fundamental analysis. Red flags are not noise -- they are the earliest signal of future value destruction.**

Financial models assume honest inputs, but management controls the inputs. Governance failures precede financial failures by years -- sometimes by a decade. The red flag checklist exists to systematically identify management-related risks before they show up in the numbers, because by the time they appear in the financials, permanent capital loss has already occurred.

The uncomfortable truth: analysts routinely dismiss governance concerns as "qualitative" and non-material, until the write-down or restatement proves otherwise. The most expensive words in investing are "management assured us." This framework forces a structured, evidence-based assessment of management risk using SEC filings and public records -- not management presentations and investor day charm. Every red flag in this checklist has a specific source document and a specific severity rating, because vague "concerns about management" are as useless as no assessment at all.
