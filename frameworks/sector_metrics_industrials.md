# Industrials Sector Metrics Framework

> **Classification:** INDUSTRIALS SECTOR KPI FRAMEWORK
> **Applied To:** All industrial companies (aerospace & defense, machinery, transportation, industrial services) entering the HFRT pipeline
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Framework Owner:** @Sector_Industrials

## Core Principle

**Industrial companies are cycle machines. The single most important question is where you are in the cycle -- everything else is precision on top of that judgment.**

Industrials are the most cycle-sensitive sector in the market. The same company looks cheap at the peak (peak earnings, moderate multiple) and expensive at the trough (trough earnings, high multiple). The framework provides cycle positioning tools alongside sub-sector KPIs because analyzing an industrial company without understanding the cycle is like navigating without knowing which direction is north. PMI, durable goods orders, capacity utilization -- these leading indicators determine whether the next 12 months bring expansion or contraction.

The uncomfortable truth: most industrial stock analysis confuses cycle position for company quality. A machinery company reporting record margins at the cycle peak is not "executing well" -- it is benefiting from a cyclical tailwind that will reverse. An aerospace company with a declining book-to-bill is not "losing competitiveness" -- it may simply be past the order peak. The framework forces cycle-aware analysis by requiring leading indicator assessment alongside operating metrics. Know where you are in the cycle before you decide whether the stock is cheap or expensive.

## Cycle Positioning Framework

### Cycle Stages

| Stage | Indicators | Duration | Investment Implication |
|-------|------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Early Cycle** | PMI rising from trough, inventory rebuild | 12-18 months | Buy cyclicals |
| **Mid Cycle** | Steady growth, capacity expansion | 24-36 months | Hold/selective |
| **Late Cycle** | Capacity constraints, margin pressure | 12-18 months | Reduce exposure |
| **Downturn** | PMI declining, destocking | 6-18 months | Defensive positioning |

### Leading Indicators

| Indicator | Source | Lead Time |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ISM PMI | ISM | 3-6 months |
| Durable Goods Orders | Census | 3-6 months |
| Industrial Production | Fed | 1-3 months |
| Capacity Utilization | Fed | Coincident |
| Inventory/Sales Ratio | Census | 1-3 months |

*In industrials, timing the cycle matters more than picking the company. Know where you are before you decide where to invest.*
