# Consumer Sector Metrics Framework

> **Classification:** CONSUMER SECTOR KPI FRAMEWORK
> **Applied To:** All consumer companies (retail, restaurants, CPG, apparel, leisure) entering the HFRT pipeline
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Framework Owner:** @Sector_Consumer

## Core Principle

**Consumer businesses live or die by same-store sales decomposition. Traffic times ticket tells the real story -- revenue growth without traffic growth is a company borrowing from its future.**

Consumer sector analysis requires sub-sector-specific KPIs because a restaurant, a retailer, and a CPG company have entirely different operating models despite all being "consumer." A restaurant chain's unit economics (AUV, 4-wall margins, new unit ROIC) bear no resemblance to a CPG company's brand health metrics (household penetration, organic growth, market share). The framework provides the right metrics for each sub-sector and defines what "good" looks like with specific benchmarks, not relative hand-waving.

The uncomfortable truth: most consumer stock pitches rely on brand narrative rather than unit economics. A restaurant chain with beautiful branding but new unit ROIC below 15% is destroying value with every new opening. A retailer with positive comps driven entirely by ticket (while traffic declines) is raising prices on a shrinking customer base -- a strategy with a shelf life. The numbers, not the brand story, determine the investment case.

## Retail (Specialty, Department, E-commerce)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **Comp Sales** | Same-store sales growth | >5% | 0-5% | Negative |
| **Traffic** | Store/site visits | Positive | Flat | Negative |
| **Ticket** | Average transaction value | Increasing | Stable | Declining |
| **Sales/Sq Ft** | Revenue productivity | >$500 | $300-500 | <$300 |
| **Inventory Turn** | COGS / Avg Inventory | >4x | 3-4x | <3x |
| **Gross Margin** | Gross Profit / Revenue | >40% | 30-40% | <30% |
| **4-Wall EBITDA** | Store-level profitability | >15% | 10-15% | <10% |

### E-Commerce Specific

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| CAC | Customer Acquisition Cost | Declining |
| LTV/CAC | Lifetime Value / CAC | >3x |
| AOV | Average Order Value | Stable/Up |
| Conversion Rate | Orders / Visits | >2% |
| Repeat Rate | % returning customers | >30% |
| Contribution Margin | After variable costs | Positive |

### Comp Sales Decomposition
```
Comp Sales = Traffic Change + Ticket Change
Ticket = Units per Transaction x Average Unit Retail (AUR)
```

### Red Flags
- Negative comps for 2+ quarters
- Traffic declining while ticket rising (unsustainable)
- Rising inventory faster than sales
- Increasing promotional activity
- Customer acquisition costs rising
- Market share losses to competitors
