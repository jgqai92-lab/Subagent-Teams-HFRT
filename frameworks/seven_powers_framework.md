# Seven Powers Framework

> **Classification:** SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IDENTIFICATION FRAMEWORK
> **Applied To:** Every company undergoing moat source identification in the HFRT pipeline

## Core Principle

**There are exactly seven sources of sustainable competitive advantage. If you cannot identify which one a company possesses, it does not have a moat -- it has a temporary lead.**

Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers framework provides the most rigorous taxonomy of competitive advantage sources available. Unlike generic "moat" discussions, each Power has a specific mechanism, specific evidence requirements, and a specific durability profile. The framework is applied alongside the Moat Assessment to identify not just whether a moat exists, but which specific Power(s) create it and how durable each is.

The uncomfortable truth: most companies claim multiple powers but evidence supports at most one or two. Claiming "network effects" without demonstrating that value increases with each additional user is wishful thinking, not analysis. Claiming "brand power" without demonstrating a measurable price premium over unbranded alternatives is marketing, not competitive advantage. This framework forces the analyst to name the specific Power, present the specific evidence, and score the specific strength. Vague moat claims do not survive this process -- and that is the point.

## The Seven Powers

### 1. Scale Economies
**Definition:** A business where unit costs decline as production volume increases.

**How It Works:**
- Fixed costs spread over larger volume
- Purchasing power from volume
- Specialized assets become economical

**Evidence Required:**
- Declining unit costs with scale
- Larger competitors have cost advantage
- Smaller competitors struggle to compete on price

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost advantage magnitude | |
| Difficulty for smaller players to match | |
| Durability of scale advantage | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the cost advantage per unit vs. smaller competitors?
- How large must a competitor be to achieve similar costs?
- Is scale advantage growing or shrinking?

---

### 2. Network Effects
**Definition:** Value of the product/service increases as more users adopt it.

**Types:**
- **Direct:** More users = more value to each user (social networks)
- **Indirect:** More users = more complementors = more value (platforms)
- **Two-sided:** More buyers attract sellers and vice versa (marketplaces)

**Evidence Required:**
- Usage/engagement increases with user base
- Switching costs rise with network size
- Clear flywheel dynamics

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Value increase per additional user | |
| Lock-in strength | |
| Multi-homing risk (users on multiple networks) | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- How does value change as users increase?
- What's the multi-homing rate?
- Is there a tipping point where network becomes dominant?

---

### 3. Counter-Positioning
**Definition:** A newcomer adopts a superior business model that incumbents cannot copy without damaging their existing business.

**How It Works:**
- New entrant has business model that cannibalizes incumbent
- Incumbent faces "innovator's dilemma"
- Rational for incumbent to ignore threat

**Evidence Required:**
- Business model creates real customer value
- Incumbent copying would harm existing profits
- Incumbent choosing not to respond

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Damage to incumbent if copied | |
| Superiority of new model | |
| Time until incumbent must respond | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- Why can't/won't incumbents copy the model?
- How long until incumbents must respond?
- What happens when they do respond?

---

### 4. Switching Costs
**Definition:** Costs (financial, procedural, relational) that customers incur when switching to a competitor.

**Types:**
- **Financial:** Contractual penalties, retraining costs
- **Procedural:** Learning new systems, data migration
- **Relational:** Personal relationships, trust, customization

**Evidence Required:**
- High customer retention rates
- Low churn despite competitive alternatives
- Customers willing to pay premium to avoid switching

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Magnitude of switching costs | |
| Customer retention rate | |
| Price premium sustainable | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What does it cost customers to switch?
- What is customer retention rate?
- Are switching costs increasing or decreasing?

---

### 5. Branding
**Definition:** A business that enjoys a higher perceived value or lower perceived risk due to its brand.

**How It Works:**
- Customers willing to pay premium for brand
- Brand reduces customer search/evaluation costs
- Brand signals quality or status

**Evidence Required:**
- Price premium vs. unbranded alternatives
- Customer preference in blind tests vs. branded
- High unprompted brand awareness

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Price premium magnitude | |
| Brand awareness/preference | |
| Brand consistency over time | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What price premium does the brand command?
- How does the brand perform in blind tests?
- Is brand equity growing or eroding?

---

### 6. Cornered Resource
**Definition:** Preferential access at attractive terms to a valuable resource that enhances value.

**Types:**
- **Talent:** Key individuals or teams
- **Technology:** Patents, proprietary tech, trade secrets
- **Natural resources:** Mineral rights, locations
- **Regulatory:** Licenses, approvals, franchises

**Evidence Required:**
- Exclusive or preferential access to resource
- Resource is valuable to business outcomes
- Access cannot be easily replicated

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Exclusivity of access | |
| Value of resource to business | |
| Duration of advantage | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the resource and why is it valuable?
- How exclusive is access?
- How long will exclusive access last?

---

### 7. Process Power
**Definition:** Embedded organizational practices and processes that enable superior value delivery.

**How It Works:**
- Tacit knowledge embedded in organization
- Processes refined over time
- Cannot be easily observed or copied

**Evidence Required:**
- Consistent operational excellence vs. peers
- Advantage persists despite competitor efforts to copy
- Deep organizational learning

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Performance gap vs. competitors | |
| Persistence of advantage over time | |
| Difficulty for competitors to copy | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What operational metrics demonstrate superiority?
- How long has the advantage persisted?
- Why can't competitors copy the processes?

## Moat Scoring Summary

| Power | Present? | Strength (1-5) | Evidence | Durability (Years) |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Scale Economies | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| Network Effects | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| Counter-Positioning | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| Switching Costs | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| Branding | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| Cornered Resource | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| Process Power | Y/N/Partial | | | |
| **Total Score** | | /35 | | |

## Moat Classification

| Score Range | Moat Rating |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0-7 | None |
| 8-15 | Narrow |
| 16-25 | Wide |
| 26-35 | Very Wide |

## Connection to Valuation
- Companies with durable moats deserve higher multiples
- Moat strength affects terminal value assumptions
- Moat durability affects DCF projection period

## Red Flags
- No identifiable power
- Power based on temporary factors
- Moat erosion trends
- Competitor with stronger power emerging
