# Seven Powers Framework

## Purpose
Identify and assess sustainable competitive advantages (moats) that allow a company to maintain superior returns over time. Based on Hamilton Helmer's "7 Powers" framework.

## The Seven Powers

### 1. Scale Economies
**Definition:** A business where unit costs decline as production volume increases.

**How It Works:**
- Fixed costs spread over larger volume
- Purchasing power from volume
- Specialized assets become economical

**Evidence Required:**
- Declining unit costs with scale
- Larger competitors have cost advantage
- Smaller competitors struggle to compete on price

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost advantage magnitude | |
| Difficulty for smaller players to match | |
| Durability of scale advantage | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the cost advantage per unit vs. smaller competitors?
- How large must a competitor be to achieve similar costs?
- Is scale advantage growing or shrinking?

---

### 2. Network Effects
**Definition:** Value of the product/service increases as more users adopt it.

**Types:**
- **Direct:** More users = more value to each user (social networks)
- **Indirect:** More users = more complementors = more value (platforms)
- **Two-sided:** More buyers attract sellers and vice versa (marketplaces)

**Evidence Required:**
- Usage/engagement increases with user base
- Switching costs rise with network size
- Clear flywheel dynamics

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Value increase per additional user | |
| Lock-in strength | |
| Multi-homing risk (users on multiple networks) | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- How does value change as users increase?
- What's the multi-homing rate?
- Is there a tipping point where network becomes dominant?

---

### 3. Counter-Positioning
**Definition:** A newcomer adopts a superior business model that incumbents cannot copy without damaging their existing business.

**How It Works:**
- New entrant has business model that cannibalizes incumbent
- Incumbent faces "innovator's dilemma"
- Rational for incumbent to ignore threat

**Evidence Required:**
- Business model creates real customer value
- Incumbent copying would harm existing profits
- Incumbent choosing not to respond

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Damage to incumbent if copied | |
| Superiority of new model | |
| Time until incumbent must respond | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- Why can't/won't incumbents copy the model?
- How long until incumbents must respond?
- What happens when they do respond?

---

### 4. Switching Costs
**Definition:** Costs (financial, procedural, relational) that customers incur when switching to a competitor.

**Types:**
- **Financial:** Contractual penalties, retraining costs
- **Procedural:** Learning new systems, data migration
- **Relational:** Personal relationships, trust, customization

**Evidence Required:**
- High customer retention rates
- Low churn despite competitive alternatives
- Customers willing to pay premium to avoid switching

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Magnitude of switching costs | |
| Customer retention rate | |
| Price premium sustainable | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What does it cost customers to switch?
- What is customer retention rate?
- Are switching costs increasing or decreasing?

---

### 5. Branding
**Definition:** A business that enjoys a higher perceived value or lower perceived risk due to its brand.

**How It Works:**
- Customers willing to pay premium for brand
- Brand reduces customer search/evaluation costs
- Brand signals quality or status

**Evidence Required:**
- Price premium vs. unbranded alternatives
- Customer preference in blind tests vs. branded
- High unprompted brand awareness

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Price premium magnitude | |
| Brand awareness/preference | |
| Brand consistency over time | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What price premium does the brand command?
- How does the brand perform in blind tests?
- Is brand equity growing or eroding?

---

### 6. Cornered Resource
**Definition:** Preferential access at attractive terms to a valuable resource that enhances value.

**Types:**
- **Talent:** Key individuals or teams
- **Technology:** Patents, proprietary tech, trade secrets
- **Natural resources:** Mineral rights, locations
- **Regulatory:** Licenses, approvals, franchises

**Evidence Required:**
- Exclusive or preferential access to resource
- Resource is valuable to business outcomes
- Access cannot be easily replicated

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Exclusivity of access | |
| Value of resource to business | |
| Duration of advantage | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the resource and why is it valuable?
- How exclusive is access?
- How long will exclusive access last?

---

### 7. Process Power
**Definition:** Embedded organizational practices and processes that enable superior value delivery.

**How It Works:**
- Tacit knowledge embedded in organization
- Processes refined over time
- Cannot be easily observed or copied

**Evidence Required:**
- Consistent operational excellence vs. peers
- Advantage persists despite competitor efforts to copy
- Deep organizational learning

**Strength Assessment:**
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Performance gap vs. competitors | |
| Persistence of advantage over time | |
| Difficulty for competitors to copy | |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What operational metrics demonstrate superiority?
- How long has the advantage persisted?
- Why can't competitors copy the processes?

## Moat Classification

| Score Range | Moat Rating |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0-7 | None |
| 8-15 | Narrow |
| 16-25 | Wide |
| 26-35 | Very Wide |

## Integration with Investment Analysis

### Where This Appears in Research
- 03_COMPETITIVE_POSITION.md (primary)
- 11_INVESTMENT_THESIS.md (moat durability)

### Connection to Valuation
- Companies with durable moats deserve higher multiples
- Moat strength affects terminal value assumptions
- Moat durability affects DCF projection period

## Red Flags
- No identifiable power
- Power based on temporary factors
- Moat erosion trends
- Competitor with stronger power emerging
