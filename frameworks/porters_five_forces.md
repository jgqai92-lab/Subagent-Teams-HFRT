# Porter's Five Forces Framework

## Purpose
Analyze industry structure and competitive dynamics to assess the attractiveness of an industry and the sustainability of competitive positions within it.

## The Five Forces

### 1. Competitive Rivalry
**Question:** How intense is competition among existing players?

**Factors to Assess:**
| Factor | Low Rivalry | High Rivalry |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Number of competitors | Few, unequal size | Many, similar size |
| Industry growth | High growth | Low/declining growth |
| Fixed costs | Low | High |
| Product differentiation | High | Low (commodity) |
| Switching costs | High | Low |
| Exit barriers | Low | High |
| Strategic stakes | Low | High |

**Assessment Questions:**
- How many direct competitors exist?
- Are competitors similar in size and capability?
- Is the industry growing or mature?
- How differentiated are products/services?
- What are the fixed costs and capacity dynamics?

### 2. Threat of New Entrants
**Question:** How easy is it for new competitors to enter?

**Barriers to Entry:**
| Barrier | Description | Assessment |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Economies of scale | Cost advantages from size | High/Medium/Low |
| Capital requirements | Investment needed to compete | High/Medium/Low |
| Brand identity | Importance of brand recognition | High/Medium/Low |
| Switching costs | Cost for customers to switch | High/Medium/Low |
| Access to distribution | Control of channels | High/Medium/Low |
| Absolute cost advantages | Patents, learning curve, access | High/Medium/Low |
| Government policy | Regulations, licensing | High/Medium/Low |
| Expected retaliation | Likelihood of incumbent response | High/Medium/Low |

**Assessment Questions:**
- What capital is required to enter?
- Are there significant economies of scale?
- Do incumbents have cost advantages?
- How strong are incumbent brands?
- Are there regulatory barriers?

### 3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
**Question:** How much leverage do suppliers have?

**Factors:**
| Factor | Low Power | High Power |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Supplier concentration | Many suppliers | Few suppliers |
| Substitute inputs | Available | Not available |
| Importance to supplier | Major customer | Minor customer |
| Switching costs | Low | High |
| Forward integration | Unlikely | Possible |
| Differentiation | Commodity inputs | Differentiated inputs |

**Assessment Questions:**
- How concentrated is the supply base?
- Are there substitute inputs available?
- How important is this industry to suppliers?
- Can suppliers forward integrate?

### 4. Bargaining Power of Buyers
**Question:** How much leverage do customers have?

**Factors:**
| Factor | Low Power | High Power |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Buyer concentration | Many small buyers | Few large buyers |
| Purchase volume | Small | Large |
| Switching costs | High | Low |
| Buyer information | Limited | Full |
| Backward integration | Unlikely | Possible |
| Price sensitivity | Low | High |
| Product importance | Critical | Non-critical |

**Assessment Questions:**
- How concentrated are buyers?
- What portion of their costs is this product?
- How differentiated is the product?
- Can buyers backward integrate?
- How price sensitive are buyers?

### 5. Threat of Substitutes
**Question:** What alternatives exist for customers?

**Factors:**
| Factor | Low Threat | High Threat |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Substitute availability | None/few | Many |
| Price-performance ratio | Worse | Better |
| Switching costs | High | Low |
| Buyer propensity to substitute | Low | High |

**Assessment Questions:**
- What substitutes exist?
- What is the price-performance of substitutes?
- What is the cost of switching to substitutes?
- How likely are customers to switch?

### Force Summary Table

| Force | Rating (1-5) | Impact | Key Factors |
|-------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Competitive Rivalry | | [+/-] | |
| Threat of New Entrants | | [+/-] | |
| Supplier Power | | [+/-] | |
| Buyer Power | | [+/-] | |
| Threat of Substitutes | | [+/-] | |
| **Overall Industry Attractiveness** | | | |

**Rating Scale:**
- 1 = Very Favorable (low force)
- 3 = Neutral
- 5 = Very Unfavorable (high force)

### Industry Attractiveness Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:** [Attractive / Neutral / Unattractive]

**Key Dynamics:**
1. [Most important dynamic]
2. [Second most important]
3. [Third most important]

**Implications for Investment:**
[How does industry structure affect the investment thesis?]

### Connection to Moat Analysis
Porter's Five Forces identifies industry dynamics; Seven Powers identifies company-specific advantages within that industry. Use together for complete competitive analysis.

## Red Flags
- Industry with unfavorable scores on 3+ forces
- Deteriorating industry structure over time
- Company without moat in attractive industry (attracts competition)
- Company with moat in unattractive industry (limited upside)
