# Healthcare Sector Metrics Framework

## Purpose
Define key performance indicators and benchmarks for healthcare companies across sub-sectors.

## Pharmaceuticals

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **R&D Productivity** | Drugs approved / R&D spend | >0.5 per $1B | 0.2-0.5 | <0.2 |
| **Pipeline Depth** | # of Phase II/III candidates | Diversified | Moderate | Concentrated |
| **LOE Exposure** | Revenue at risk from patent expiry | <10% in 3 years | 10-20% | >20% |
| **Gross-to-Net** | Net revenue / Gross revenue | >75% | 60-75% | <60% |
| **R&D %** | R&D / Revenue | 15-20% | 10-25% | Extremes |
| **SG&A %** | SG&A / Revenue | <25% | 25-35% | >35% |

### Pipeline Analysis Framework

| Phase | Success Probability | Typical Timeline |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Preclinical | 10-15% | 2-4 years |
| Phase I | 15-25% | 1-2 years |
| Phase II | 25-35% | 2-3 years |
| Phase III | 50-70% | 2-4 years |
| Filing/Approval | 85-95% | 1-2 years |

### Patent Cliff Analysis
| Year | Revenue at LOE | Replacement Pipeline |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Year 1 | $[X]M | [Pipeline asset] |
| Year 2 | $[X]M | [Pipeline asset] |
| Year 3 | $[X]M | [Pipeline asset] |

### Red Flags
- Heavy reliance on single drug (>30% revenue)
- Upcoming LOE without replacement
- Declining R&D productivity
- Increasing gross-to-net spreads
- Regulatory/pricing pressure on key drugs

## Biotechnology

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Assessment |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Cash Runway** | Cash / Monthly burn | >24 months preferred |

| **Platform Value** | Tech platform optionality | Assessed separately |
| **Partnership Income** | Milestone/royalty revenue | Stability indicator |
| **Burn Rate** | Monthly cash consumption | Trend analysis |

### Risk-Adjusted Pipeline Valuation

| Stage | Success Rate | NPV Weight |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Preclinical | 10% | 0.10x |
| Phase I | 20% | 0.20x |
| Phase II | 30% | 0.30x |
| Phase III | 60% | 0.60x |
| Filed | 90% | 0.90x |
| Approved | 100% | 1.00x |

### Binary Event Assessment
| Event | Date | Bull Outcome | Bear Outcome | Probability |
|-------|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| [Trial] | [Date] | +[X]% | -[X]% | [%] |

### Red Flags
- Cash runway <18 months without financing plan
- Binary event risk (single late-stage asset)
- Repeated trial delays or protocol amendments
- Competitive assets ahead in development
- Platform without near-term catalysts
