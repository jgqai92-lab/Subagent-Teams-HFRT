## Core Principle

**A thesis without a catalyst is a prayer. Something must happen to unlock value, and that something must be specific, timed, and measurable.**

"Cheap" is not a catalyst. Catalysts are what separate deep value traps from value investments. Without an identifiable, timed event, there is no mechanism for the market to re-rate a stock. A company can trade at 6x earnings for a decade if nothing forces the market to reassess its assumptions. The catalyst is the forcing function.

The uncomfortable truth: most "catalysts" that analysts cite are too vague to be actionable. "Eventually the market will recognize value" is not a catalyst -- it is a hope. A real catalyst has a date (or date range), a measurement (how will we know it happened), and a probability (how likely is it). This framework demands all three for every catalyst identified. If you cannot specify when, how, and how likely, you do not have a catalyst -- you have a wish.

The HFRT invariant is absolute: **no position recommendation without an identified catalyst.** This is not a suggestion. It is a gate.

## What is a Catalyst?

A **catalyst** is an event or development that will cause the market to reassess the value of a stock. Key characteristics:
- **Specific:** Not just "growth" but what will demonstrate growth
- **Timing:** When will it happen (or at least a range)
- **Measurable:** How will we know if it succeeded
- **Material:** Significant enough to move the stock

**Note:** "Cheap" is NOT a catalyst. Something must happen to unlock value.
