# Energy & Materials Sector Metrics Framework

> **Classification:** ENERGY AND MATERIALS SECTOR KPI FRAMEWORK
> **Applied To:** All energy and materials companies (E&P, midstream, integrated, utilities, mining, chemicals, OFS) entering the HFRT pipeline
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Framework Owner:** @Sector_Energy_Materials

## Core Principle

**Energy and materials companies are cost-curve businesses. Your position on the cost curve determines whether you survive the cycle -- everything else is commentary.**

This sector is fundamentally different from growth-oriented sectors. Here, cycle positioning and cost structure dominate all other factors. A company in the first quartile of the cost curve survives any downturn; a company in the fourth quartile is the first casualty. The framework provides sub-sector-specific KPIs calibrated to the unique economics of each business model -- E&P breakevens, midstream coverage ratios, utility regulatory dynamics, mining AISC -- because a single "energy sector" framework is meaningless when an E&P company and a regulated utility have nothing in common except a GICS code.

The uncomfortable truth: energy/materials analysts routinely extrapolate peak-cycle margins into the future and call it "structural." Every cycle, the same mistake is made: "This time supply discipline will hold." "This time the commodity supercycle is real." The framework forces cycle-aware analysis by requiring both current metrics AND through-cycle benchmarks. If the investment case only works at $80 oil, it doesn't work.

## Exploration & Production (E&P)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **F&D Cost** | Finding & Development cost per BOE | <$10/BOE | $10-15 | >$15 |
| **Reserve Replacement** | Reserves added / Production | >150% | 100-150% | <100% |
| **Reserve Life** | Proved reserves / Annual production | >10 years | 7-10 years | <7 years |
| **Recycle Ratio** | Netback / F&D cost | >2.0x | 1.5-2.0x | <1.5x |
| **Cash Breakeven** | Price needed for cash neutrality | <$40/bbl | $40-50 | >$50 |
| **EBITDAX/BOE** | Cash flow per barrel | >$30 | $20-30 | <$20 |
| **LOE/BOE** | Lease Operating Expense | <$10 | $10-15 | >$15 |
| **Debt/EBITDAX** | Leverage ratio | <1.5x | 1.5-2.5x | >2.5x |

| **FCF Yield** | Free Cash Flow / Enterprise Value | >10% | 5-10% | <5% |

### Production Economics
```
Netback = Realized Price - Royalties - LOE - Gathering/Transport

Cash Margin = Netback - Cash G&A - Cash Interest

FCF = Cash Margin x Production - Capex

Breakeven = (Capex + OpEx + G&A + Interest) / Production
```

### Reserve Classification

| Category | Definition | Valuation Weight |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Proved Developed (PDP) | Producing wells | 100% |
| Proved Undeveloped (PUD) | Approved locations | 50-70% |
| Probable | Reasonably certain | 20-40% |
| Possible | Speculative | 10-20% |

### Basin/Play Considerations

| Basin | Breakeven Range | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Permian | $35-50 | Multi-zone, oil-weighted |
| Eagle Ford | $40-55 | Oil/condensate |
| Bakken | $45-55 | Light oil |
| Appalachia | $1.50-2.50/mcf | Dry gas/NGL |
| Haynesville | $2.00-2.75/mcf | Dry gas |

### Red Flags
- Reserve replacement <100% for multiple years
- Rising F&D costs
- Declining well productivity (IP30, EUR)
- Hedging losses impacting realizations
- Debt/EBITDAX >3x
- PUD % of reserves >50%
- Significant asset impairments

## Midstream (Pipelines, Gathering, Processing)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|

| **Contract Duration** | Weighted avg remaining term | >7 years | 5-7 years | <5 years |

### Cash Flow Waterfall
```
EBITDA
- Maintenance Capex
- Cash Interest
- Preferred Distributions
= Distributable Cash Flow (DCF)

DCF / Common Distribution = Coverage Ratio
```

### Contract Types

|------|------------|------------|------------------|
| Fee-Based | None | None | Highest |
| Fee + MVCs | Limited | None | High |
| Percent of Proceeds | Full | Full | Low |
| Keep-Whole | Limited | Full | Medium |

### Red Flags
- Coverage <1.1x
- Distribution cut history
- High commodity exposure
- Customer concentration (>25% single customer)
- Significant contract expirations near-term
- Leverage >4.5x without clear path down
- Negative volume trends in basins served

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **Upstream Cash Margin** | $/BOE after opex | >$30 | $20-30 | <$20 |

### Segment Profitability
```
Upstream: Volume x (Price - Cost) = Margin
Downstream: Throughput x Margin/bbl = EBIT
Chemicals: Revenue x EBITDA Margin = EBITDA
Corporate: Overhead + Interest

Integrated Benefit: Counter-cyclical offsets between segments
```

### Red Flags

Regulatory Lag = Time between spending and rate recovery
```

### Regulatory Jurisdiction Quality

| Characteristic | Constructive | Challenging |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| ROE Allowed | >9.5% | <9% |
| Rate Case Frequency | Regular/formula | Infrequent |
| Cost Recovery | Timely riders | Rate case only |
| Political Environment | Supportive | Adversarial |
| Capital Tracker | Yes | No |

## Mining (Diversified, Precious Metals, Base Metals)

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Best-in-Class | Good | Concerning |
|--------|------------|---------------|------|------------|
| **AISC** | All-In Sustaining Cost | Bottom quartile | 2nd quartile | Top half |
| **Reserve Life** | Reserves / Annual production | >15 years | 10-15 years | <10 years |
| **Grade Trend** | Ore grade over time | Stable/improving | Slight decline | Significant decline |
| **Recovery Rate** | Metal recovered / Ore processed | >90% | 85-90% | <85% |

### AISC Calculation
```
Cash Costs (mining, processing, G&A)
+ Sustaining Capex
+ Exploration (sustaining)
+ Reclamation Amortization
= All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC)

AISC Margin = Realized Price - AISC
```

### Cost Curve Position

| Position | Margin Safety | Cycle Resilience |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| 1st Quartile | High | Survives any cycle |
| 2nd Quartile | Moderate | Survives most downturns |
| 3rd Quartile | Limited | Vulnerable in downturns |
| 4th Quartile | None | First to cut production |

### Red Flags
- Rising AISC
- Grade decline without offset
- Jurisdictional risk (nationalization, permitting)
- Water/power constraints
- Tailings dam concerns
- Labor relations issues
- Development projects with cost overruns

### Margin Analysis
```
Commodity Chemicals: Spread = Product Price - Feedstock

Specialty Chemicals: Value-added margin less feedstock sensitive

Integrated Margin = Upstream + Downstream benefits
```

### Segment Characteristics

| Segment | Cyclicality | Margin Profile | Pricing Power |
|---------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Commodity | Very High | Low, volatile | None |
| Performance | Moderate | Medium | Some |

E&P Spending -> OFS Demand -> OFS Pricing -> OFS Margins
```

### Red Flags
- Rig count declining
- Pricing pressure from oversupply
- Customer concentration
- International exposure to unstable regions
- Working capital build during downturn
- Technology obsolescence

## Energy & Materials Valuation Context

### Typical Multiples

| Sub-Sector | EV/EBITDA | P/CF | P/NAV | Key Driver |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| E&P | 3-6x | 3-5x | 0.7-1.2x | Commodity, reserves |
| Midstream | 8-12x | 6-10x | N/A | DCF coverage, contract |
| Integrated | 4-6x | 5-8x | N/A | Cash returns, portfolio |
| Utilities | 10-14x | N/A | N/A | Rate base growth, reg |
| Mining | 4-8x | 5-10x | 0.8-1.5x | Cost curve, reserves |
| Chemicals | 6-10x | N/A | N/A | Cycle, specialty mix |
| OFS | 4-8x | N/A | N/A | Utilization, E&P spend |

### Cycle Adjustment

| Cycle Position | Valuation Approach |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Trough | Higher multiple on depressed earnings |
| Recovery | Multiple expansion on improving fundamentals |
| Peak | Lower multiple on elevated earnings |
| Downturn | Through-cycle earnings focus |

### NAV Methodology (E&P/Mining)
```
PV of Proved Developed Reserves (PDP)
+ PV of Proved Undeveloped (PUD) x Risk Factor
+ Probable/Possible x Risk Factor
+ Other Assets (midstream, infrastructure)
- Net Debt
- Asset Retirement Obligations
= Net Asset Value (NAV)
```
