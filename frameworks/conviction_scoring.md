# Conviction Scoring Framework

## Purpose
Systematically assess investment conviction to ensure consistent position sizing and portfolio construction decisions.

## Conviction Score Definition

The **conviction score** is a 1-5 rating that reflects confidence in the investment thesis based on multiple factors. It directly maps to position sizing recommendations.

## Scoring Rubric

### Factor Definitions

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Thesis Clarity** | 20% | How clear, specific, and differentiated is the thesis? |
| **Moat Strength** | 20% | How strong and durable is the competitive advantage? |
| **Catalyst Clarity** | 20% | How identifiable and timely are the catalysts? |
| **Risk/Reward** | 20% | How attractive is the asymmetry of outcomes? |
| **Data Quality** | 10% | How complete and reliable is the research? |
| **Management Quality** | 10% | How capable and aligned is management? |

### Individual Factor Scoring

#### Thesis Clarity (20%)

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 5 | Unique, highly specific thesis with clear variant perception |
| 4 | Clear thesis with identifiable market misperception |
| 3 | Reasonable thesis but limited differentiation |
| 2 | Generic thesis with unclear differentiation |
| 1 | No clear thesis or highly speculative |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What specifically is the market missing?
- Why are we right and the market wrong?
- How differentiated is our view?

#### Moat Strength (20%)

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 5 | Wide moat with multiple durable sources, strengthening |
| 4 | Wide or strong narrow moat, stable |
| 3 | Narrow moat, stable |
| 2 | Weak moat or narrow moat that's eroding |
| 1 | No moat or rapidly eroding moat |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the source of competitive advantage?
- How long can advantage persist?
- Is the moat strengthening or weakening?

#### Catalyst Clarity (20%)

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 5 | Multiple clear catalysts with specific timing in next 6 months |
| 4 | At least one clear catalyst with reasonable timing estimate |
| 3 | Catalyst identified but timing uncertain |
| 2 | Vague catalyst or very uncertain timing |
| 1 | No identifiable catalyst ("just cheap") |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What will cause the market to re-rate?
- When will the catalyst occur?
- How confident are we in the catalyst?

#### Risk/Reward (20%)

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 5 | >3:1 upside/downside ratio with high probability of base case |
| 4 | 2-3:1 ratio with reasonable base case probability |
| 3 | 1-2:1 ratio, balanced risk/reward |
| 2 | <1:1 ratio or high uncertainty on outcomes |
| 1 | Unfavorable risk/reward or extreme uncertainty |

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the upside to bull case?
- What is the downside to bear case?
- What is the probability-weighted expected return?

#### Data Quality (10%)

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 5 | Comprehensive research with all key questions answered |
| 4 | Solid research with minor gaps |
| 3 | Adequate research but some meaningful gaps |
| 2 | Significant data gaps affecting confidence |
| 1 | Major data gaps or unverifiable claims |

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are there significant data gaps?
- How verifiable is the analysis?
- Is there meaningful uncertainty from data limitations?

#### Management Quality (10%)

| Score | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| 5 | Excellent track record, strong alignment, no red flags |
| 4 | Good track record, reasonable alignment, minor concerns |
| 3 | Adequate management, some concerns |
| 2 | Meaningful concerns about capability or alignment |
| 1 | Significant red flags or poor track record |

**Questions to Answer:**
- Does management have a track record of execution?
- Is management aligned with shareholders?
- Are there governance red flags?

## Conviction Calculation

### Weighted Score Calculation

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Thesis Clarity | 20% | [X] | [X × 0.20] |
| Moat Strength | 20% | [X] | [X × 0.20] |
| Catalyst Clarity | 20% | [X] | [X × 0.20] |
| Risk/Reward | 20% | [X] | [X × 0.20] |
| Data Quality | 10% | [X] | [X × 0.10] |
| Management Quality | 10% | [X] | [X × 0.10] |
| **Total Conviction** | 100% | | **[Sum]** |

### Conviction to Score Mapping

| Weighted Score | Conviction Level | Description |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 4.5-5.0 | **5 - Very High** | Strong thesis, clear catalyst, asymmetric R/R |
| 3.5-4.4 | **4 - High** | Solid thesis, identifiable catalyst, favorable R/R |
| 2.5-3.4 | **3 - Medium** | Reasonable thesis, catalyst timing uncertain |
| 1.5-2.4 | **2 - Low** | Thesis has holes, catalyst unclear |
| 1.0-1.4 | **1 - Very Low** | Weak thesis, no clear catalyst |

## Position Sizing Tiers

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Size Range | Conviction | Additional Requirements |
|------|------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | 4-6% | 5 | Multiple catalysts, >3:1 R/R, wide moat |
| **Tier 2** | 2-4% | 4-5 | Clear catalyst, >2:1 R/R |
| **Tier 3** | 1-2% | 3-4 | Reasonable thesis, balanced R/R |
| **Tier 4** | 0.5-1% | 2-3 | Speculative, requires monitoring |
| **Pass** | 0% | 1-2 | Insufficient conviction |

### Tier Requirements Matrix

| Requirement | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Conviction Score | ≥4.5 | ≥3.5 | ≥2.5 | ≥1.5 |
| Catalyst Identified | Yes, multiple | Yes | Preferred | Optional |
| Risk/Reward | >3:1 | >2:1 | >1:1 | Any |
| Moat | Wide | Narrow+ | Any | Any |
| Data Completeness | High | Good | Adequate | Limited |
