| # | Trigger | Probability | Timing |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | [Trigger event] | [X]% | [When] |
| 2 | [Trigger event] | [X]% | [When] |
| 3 | [Trigger event] | [X]% | [When] |

## Short Thesis Integration

- Trend: [Increasing/Decreasing/Stable]
- Days to Cover: [X]

### Published Short Arguments

| Argument | Our Assessment | Valid? |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| [Short argument 1] | [Our counter/agreement] | [Yes/Partial/No] |
| [Short argument 2] | [Our counter/agreement] | [Yes/Partial/No] |

## Downside Protection

### What Limits Downside?

1. **[Protection 1]:** [e.g., Asset value, dividend support]
2. **[Protection 2]:** [e.g., Takeover floor, breakup value]
3. **[Protection 3]:** [e.g., Cost cutting optionality]

### Floor Valuation
