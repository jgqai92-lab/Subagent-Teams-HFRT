## Catalyst Summary

**Primary Catalyst:** [Most important catalyst]
**Catalyst Timeline:** [Expected timing]
**Catalyst Density:** [Low / Medium / High] (number of catalysts in next 12 months)

## Catalyst Framework

### What is a Catalyst?
A catalyst is an event or development that will cause the market to re-rate the stock, either positively or negatively. "Cheap" is not a catalyst - something must happen to unlock value.

## Upside Catalysts

### Near-Term (0-6 months)

| Catalyst | Type | Expected Date | Probability | Impact | Source |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [Catalyst 1] | [Earnings/Product/etc.] | [Date/Quarter] | [X]% | [+X%] | [cite] |
| [Catalyst 2] | [Type] | [Date] | [X]% | [+X%] | [cite] |

### Medium-Term (6-12 months)

| Catalyst | Type | Expected Date | Probability | Impact | Source |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [Catalyst 1] | [Type] | [Date] | [X]% | [+X%] | [cite] |

### Long-Term (12+ months)

| Catalyst | Type | Expected Date | Probability | Impact | Source |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [Catalyst 1] | [Type] | [Date] | [X]% | [+X%] | [cite] |

## Downside Catalysts (Risks)

### Near-Term (0-6 months)

| Risk Catalyst | Type | Expected Date | Probability | Impact | Source |
|---------------|------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [Risk 1] | [Type] | [Date] | [X]% | [-X%] | [cite] |

### Medium-Term (6-12 months)

| Risk Catalyst | Type | Expected Date | Probability | Impact | Source |
|---------------|------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| [Risk 1] | [Type] | [Date] | [X]% | [-X%] | [cite] |
